# ProxyAndInterceptor

This is a reusable project to proxy the request to some server and intercept in the middle. 
It can be modified as per requirement. You can either use it as an interceptor or as a caching software.
I have tested the same with good amount of load as well.
Command to run and steps are mentioned in the file CommandToRun inside the project. Wiremock standalone server is also there in the repository.

Reach out for any clarifications at snegithan.vikram@gmail.com

All the best !!
